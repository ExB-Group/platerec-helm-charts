Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.  

{{- if .Values.fileUpload -}}
File Upload Service is Enabled.
{{- else }}
File Upload Service is Disabled.

Update Stream config by editing `configmap.yaml` and restart stream by upgrading helm:

  $ helm upgrade ...

If you disable file upload in the config, Also do the same in `Values.yaml` by setting `fileUpload: false`
